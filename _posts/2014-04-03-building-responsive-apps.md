title: Building responsive apps

Nowadays *responsive* webapps are in fashion, you can read a lot about it on the blogosphere. It's not a very new thing, as it's beeing used since a few years ago. This technique is used to change how a webpage look depending in which device are you using to access it.


Building responsive sites that allows a smooth experience for the user is really hard, but we can ease the proccess by using a responsive framework as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or [Fundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). I'm a Bootstrap's fan, but for a recent project, I'm using [Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) wich is under heavy development and currently doesn't have a lot of responsive components, so I used media queries to make it a bit more *mobile friendly*.

That's how my desk looks like when developing responsive apps. The one tool that I cannot live without is Google [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/), as they allow to debug and inspect websites on tablets and phone remotely. On the big monitor you can see how the website is render on the phone below. It's indeed a really nice feature. Educate yourself on how to use it and master it, you will see that's a great tool and will boost your working speed.
