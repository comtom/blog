title: Php Transparent Framework The framework that you don't need to learn anything
---

*Reinventing the wheel*

-----

A few days ago, I released a framework for small sites. The best of it is that is very simple, it implements a MTV design pattern (Model Template View) and was designed to empower others to hack it. It doesn't include an ORM (yet), but you can either include doctrine or some other, or just make your own database logic. You can fork it in GitHub: [Php Transparent Framework](https://github.com/comtom/phtf).

There is also an [example project (Friendbook)](https://github.com/comtom/Friendbook) so you can see how it works. This example project is live [here](http://friendbook.comtomtech.com/)

Hope you like it :).
