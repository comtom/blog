title: What? Is Flappy Bird Android App offline?
---

No way! Why would someone that’s being so successfull with a particular app and doing thousands of dolars each day with ads, retire it from play store and App Store. That doesn’t make any sense.

But instead of speculating about ‘why that guy did what he did’ like de 99.99% of other blogs, I’m sharing the game with all of you, games junkies :).
